# Schedule-maker
One of my first Python projects. It was a great project for me to learn how to use the TKinter module, despite the fact that it does not represent the amount of programming skills I currently have. In the future, I might come back and improve on this project to make it a lot more useful and appealing to a normal user.
In terms of using the program, the user can just type in the event name and the time it shall be done. Events can be deleted individually and are saved in a .txt file, thus the program can automatically reload them when rebooted. Should the user face any challenges, the program has its own set of instructions as well.
