# Schedule-maker
# You can make your own schedules by using this program. It was designed in a way users could quickly learn how to use it.
# In order to add an event to the schedule, the user has to type in the event's name and the time it takes place and press the button 'Add to schedule'.
# The program saves all events, thus a loss of progress is something not to be concerned about.
# Should the program prove difficult to use, it contains instructions that go in detail of how the program works.
